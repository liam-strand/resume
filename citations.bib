    abstract="The MEDFORD metadata description language was designed to enable creation of structured metadata in an ordinary text editor. This paper provides a tool that improves the ease of writing correct MEDFORD within the popular VSCode editor. This tool provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion features that generate real-time feedback in the form of suggestions which improve the discoverability of language semantics, as well as useful and informative error messages. This tool leverages the Language Server Protocol, and thus is easily ported to other text editors.",
